Author: Nathaniel Santiago  
Course: Math 2B (Linear Algebra & Applications) — Fall 2025  
Instructor: Professor Jeff Anderson


📘 Overview
This repository contains explanations and worked examples for major concepts in linear algebra, and what I've learned throughout the quarter from this class, with the help of Marus, Abel, Leman, and Pawan. These notes are formatted neatedly with the help of some AI models such as GPT and Gemini.

Included in this repository is work from this class such as my Final Assessment, Midterm, and Conquering College Lab 1

Topics covered are:
- Inner products & vector norms
- Linear combinations, span, dependence/independence
- Matrices and matrix modeling (incidence matrices, images, meshes)
- Matrix structure (shapes, sparsity, triangular forms)
- Matrix operations (outer products, rank-one updates, transposes)
- Linear systems, Gaussian elimination, LU factorization
- Matrix inverses and the Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT)
- Determinants, REF/RREF, and solution sets for linear systems

How I would use these notes
- Read the concepts, then work on examples first, then review formal definitions.
- Attempt the self-check questions and reproduce example calculations by hand.
- Use the PDF for offline study and this repo for quick lookups.
